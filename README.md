# Warframe-Collection-Logger
I am tired of using an excel sheet to keep track of what my brother and I need to get in terms of prime warframes and weapon.

So I plan on making an app to keep track of it, think similar to how Path of Building for POE does it, where you share collection lists with eachother, and you can just send it again after an update to update it on your end.

Each list will include json files for each of these, I figure this will be fine, each list you inport will be in their own folder, the folder name will have to be unique for file structure reasons, unless I decide to include a number or ID of some sort for the list to make reimporting from another person easy

Vehicles (Vehicles are such a short list that I can probably keep prime and base together, 5 archwings and 2 necramechs)

Reputations

I hope to make them searchable as well so that in a relic opening spree you can check your friends list and see if they're missing any of the items up for grabs maybe in the future some AHK script to get the name for quick searching mutliple lists

Currently in the process of flushing out the idea some more
