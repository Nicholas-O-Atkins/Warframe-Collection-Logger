# Warframe-Collection-Logger
I am tired of using an excel sheet to keep track of what my brother and I need to get in terms of prime warframes and weapon, so I plan on making an app to keep track of it, think similar to how Path of Building for POE does it, where you share collection lists with eachother, and you can just send it again after an update to update it on your end.
